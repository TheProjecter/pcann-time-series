= pcann-time-series =

== Introduction ==

This program generates, trains, and tests all combinations of neural networks
with the given set of nodes against a time series data set (one of sin, sinh,
or saw.)  It outputs results in CSV format.


== Usage ==

All files required to run this program are in src/.

All data files generated by this program are in data/.

pcann-time-series.py - Train and test all potential networks.
                       Outputs CSV dataset to STDOUT.
                       Networks must be 3 layers.
